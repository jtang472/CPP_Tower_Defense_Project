This is the trunk of a school project. It is a 2D top down tower defense game developed in C++ and using SFML as graphics library. This project is developed and tested with Ubuntu 22.\+04.\+1 LTS. In order to compile and run the project in Windows, you will need to modify the CMake\+List file to correctly reference project dependencies. \DoxyHorRuler{0}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{How To Make a Build}\label{md_README_autotoc_md3}
Please note the following steps assumes all the necessary libraries and tools required to compile C++ programs has been installed n your local machine. \hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{I. Install CMake}\label{md_README_autotoc_md4}
This project uses cmake to generate C++ makefile. Use the following command to install cmake\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get -\/y install cmake}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{II. Install boost}\label{md_README_autotoc_md5}
This project uses multiple packages from the boost library. Note the following command will install the entire boost library for you. 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install libboost-\/all-\/dev}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysubsection{III. Install rapid\+Json}\label{md_README_autotoc_md6}
This project uses rapid\+Json for in-\/game data serialization \& deserialization. Use the following command to install rapid\+Json\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install -\/y rapidjson-\/dev}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md7}{}\doxysubsection{IV. Install SFML}\label{md_README_autotoc_md7}
This project uses SFML as its multimedia library. Use the following command to install SFML\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo apt-\/get install libsfml-\/dev}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md8}{}\doxysubsection{V. Build and install LDtk Loader}\label{md_README_autotoc_md8}
This project uses Ldtk\+Loader to load LDtk tile maps into game. First, you need to run git-\/checkout to obtain a local copy of the project from github\+: \href{https://github.com/Madour/LDtkLoader}{\texttt{ https\+://github.\+com/\+Madour/\+LDtk\+Loader}}. Next, go into the root directory of your local copy of the project, run the following command to build the project on your local machine\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{mkdir build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cd build}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/DCMAKE\_BUILD\_TYPE=Release ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake -\/-\/build . -\/-\/config Release}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Next, from the build directory, run the following command to install it\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake [-\/DCMAKE\_INSTALL\_PREFIX=/install/path/LDtkLoader] ..}
\DoxyCodeLine{sudo cmake -\/-\/install . -\/-\/config Release}

\end{DoxyCode}
\hypertarget{md_README_autotoc_md9}{}\doxysubsection{VI. Make Build}\label{md_README_autotoc_md9}
Now you should have installed all the dependencies of the project, and it is time to make a build! First you need to generate makefile with cmake\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{cmake .}

\end{DoxyCode}
 Now you can build the game with the generated makefile\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{make install}

\end{DoxyCode}
 This command will create a new folder in your project directory called \textquotesingle{}install\textquotesingle{}, which will contain the game executable and all the assets it requires. ~\newline
